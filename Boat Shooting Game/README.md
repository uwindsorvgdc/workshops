## Todo
1) Make sure you have unity 2021 or higher installed on your machine, if not install the latest version so you don't run into any compatibility issues
2) Create a unity account if you haven't already 
3) Open the packages file in the repo and follow the links to add each asset to your unity account, 2 packages in total.

If you have any trouble with any of the steps above, you can shoot us a message on the discord server before hand, and we will happily help you


Note: the workshop won't cover how to make 3d moving waves, but a link to an easy quick Youtube tutorial is provided in case you would love to implement such feautres to your game :)
